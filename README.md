## Overview

Lexicon_Project is an application designed to assist users in understanding programming language concepts through AI-driven explanations and examples. It enhances learning by providing related links and terms, making complex coding terminology more accessible.

## Description

The Lexicon_Project leverages a machine learning model to interpret and respond to user queries regarding programming terms. It not only offers clear explanations and relevant examples but also suggests additional resources to deepen the user's understanding. This interactive tool is ideal for both novice and experienced programmers seeking to expand their technical vocabulary.

### Dataset

The model utilizes a dataset maintained by Antoine Bourgois, which is continuously updated to reflect the latest in AI and programming terminologies. The dataset can be accessed on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antoinebourgois2/wikipedia-ai-glossary).

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- streamlit
- pandas
- sklearn.metrics.pairwise (part of scikit-learn)
- plotly.graph_objects

### Installation

Install the required dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn plotly

```

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

Replace main.py with the path to the script if your setup requires it.
